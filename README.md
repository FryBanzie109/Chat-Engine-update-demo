### So, how to use this?
well... hear me out.
<h4>1. you need node and npm</h4>

   if you already install it, just open your powershell and check the version
   
   npm -v
   node -v
   
   if you haven't install it yet, you can install it on

   https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm

   and check the version for make sure they already exist. if can't, try to restart your powershell or restart your vscode

### still continue. i'm just need rest, i'm tired as hell :)
